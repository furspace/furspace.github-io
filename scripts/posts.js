        "body": "!!! THE BIG DAKA REVIEW !!!\n~Written by Wellsley and Opal~\n\nHEY GUYS welcome to our DAKA review! = D we are writing this instead of doing our GPS homework because it’s soooooo boring. >.< DAKA is waaaay more interesting because we eat at DAKA every day!!!!!!!\nDAKA is what we call our dining hall on campus.Its real name is Pulse On Dining, but everyone thinks it’s funnier to call it DAKA because that was the name of our food provider 20 years ago, but thennn DAKA caused a norovirus outbreak in the lettuce and they got kicked out.Everyone thinks it’s funny to call it DAKA instead out of spite.\nThe food here follows set patterns.There are some staples like the chicken.Usually they serve some sort of sandwich alongside some fried side such as fries or onion rings.There’s a main course, some veggies, some soup, and if you go in the back you’ll always find pasta and pizza.Most days in the back you’ll find the vegetarian and vegan options.\nI(Wells) LIKE DAKA. =D\nI(Opal) think DAKA is a necessary evil.\nMy(Wells) favorite food from DAKA is probably the French Onion Soup they served last Tuesday.I think my least favorite food from DAKA is, unsurprisingly, the chicken.Sometimes the chicken is pink and gives you stomach problems afterwards.However it’s always an option if you need it. =)\nMy(Opal) favorite food from daka is the pizza.It’s a gamble.Some days it’s the best fucking pizza I’ve ever had.Sometimes it’s okay.And on bad days it’s a piece of flaccid cardboard with a poor excuse for pizza sauce on top.\nWe both agree there’s a good selection of drinks here.On top of your usual soda fountain, juice, milk, coffee, and water, there is a Coke slushy machine.The slushy machine is the bomb.Thank you Chartwells for descending from the heavens and providing us with nectar from the gods.\nThere are lots of “passive” options in DAKA, things that aren’t from the grill or served to you.They have cereal, fruit, bagels, baked goods, yogurt: mainly breakfast foods.These passive options are available pretty much all the time.They have a waffle maker(also the bomb) and an ICE CREAM MACHINE here!!!!!!! I get to wake up every morning to a Belgian waffle.It is the best thing EVER =D\nWe discovered daka closes in the afternoons on weekends.Dunno why.They don’t let new people in but they won’t kick you out.It’s nice 2 enter in the morning and suck more money out of chartwells by snacking on those passive options while working on homework or using the cyber cafe.It’s this corner in daka with these shitty dell computers no one uses.Except for us.Wells made us use one 2 write this.No one else is here.\nThe Cyber Cafe isn’t that bad!! >.< The computers are just a little slow sometimes…\nThere’s 5 different types of seats in daka.The counters, long tables, round tables, small square tables, and booths.If you’re lucky and have a big group, there’s a big round table in the back room.The booths are coveted.They’re cozy and comfortable, unless the goddamn heaters are on again, in which you feel like you’re melting into a fucking puddle.\nOverall the food here isn’t too bad, it’s better than the food at both of our high schools. I think I(Wells) can eat here for a year and be satisfied.I(opal) think it’s pretty ok. I like the slushy machine.",
